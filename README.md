### Helpful Documentation

#### Stuff that I already looked at:

  - ARM ABI (https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/releases)
  - ELF(5) man page (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html)
  - Ian Lance Taylor: Linkers (https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/38)

### Software

Installed via `pacman`:

~~~none
pacman -S --needed python-invoke arm-none-eabi-gcc
~~~

Some packages have to be manually build from AUR:

- TIO to connect to serial device (http://tio.github.io/)
